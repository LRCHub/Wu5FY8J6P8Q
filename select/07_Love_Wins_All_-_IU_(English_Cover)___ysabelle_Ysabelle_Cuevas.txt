Dearest, darling, my universe
Will you take me with you to somewhere far away
Beyond wildest dreams, a place imagination can't reach?
Further away from Earth to Mars
Will you please go with me?
Wherever it may be
We'll search endlessly
Where loneliness doesn't exist

Where does the fault lie
When no matter how we try
It's you and I

Run away from the world with me, run on
Go to the end with me to see, my lover
What kind of fate awaits
What if you and I lose our way?

Take me in your loving arms forever
Kiss me like it's the last time you will ever
Love wins all
Love wins all
Love, love, love, love

Despite everything
Tell me how this will end for you and I

Run away from the world with me, run on
Go to the end with me to see, my lover
What kind of fate awaits
What if you and I lose our way?

These eyes will slowly film every moment
Only to see your serene smile again
As we let go of the day
In the horizon waits love, like the sun
Without fear
Will you set with me?

Break me tenderly
Bide your time, ruiner
Feel the pain and the sadness with me, lover

Run away from the world with me, run on
Go to the end with me to see, my lover
What kind of fate awaits
When you and I lose to find our way

Take me in your loving arms forever
Kiss me like it's the last time you will ever
Love wins all
Love wins all
Love, love, love, love
